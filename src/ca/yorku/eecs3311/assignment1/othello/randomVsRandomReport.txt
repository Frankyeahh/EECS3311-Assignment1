1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy?
Based on the results of the 10000 game simulation it seems as if the 2nd player might have some advantage
as they win roughly 3-4% more of the time.

2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA

3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:
I thought the video was a neat insight into how us "Hackers" are able to use code
to simplify methods in statistics. Jake Vanderplas did a great job and keeping his speach engaging
and it was a great insight into the world of code and statistics.

4) H0 is that the first player has no advantage over the second player

5) Ha is that the second player has some advantage over the first player

6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   My experimental results do not support H0, so they support Ha

7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0
